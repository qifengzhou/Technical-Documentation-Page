This is a brief introduction of the book "Streaming Systems", authored by Tyler Akidau, Slava Chernyak and Reuven Lax. This book reviewed how the systems were developed, and the present industrial standards and pitfalls of the current working forms and the future of the streaming systems. 

I am personally strongly recommend this book if you are curious about streaming systems, which has been becoming more and more important those days. You can get a glance of the book at https://qifengzhou.github.io/Technical-Documentation-Page/#Reference
